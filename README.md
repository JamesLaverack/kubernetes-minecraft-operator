# Kubernetes Minecraft Operator

An unoffical Kubernetes [operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) for dedicated servers of the
video game [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition).
This allows you to administer and configure a Minecraft server solely using the Kubernetes API ‚Äî no remote shell, SFTP,
or graphical admin interfaces are required.

‚ÑπÔ∏è This is **not** an offical Minecraft project. It is **not** approved by or associated with Mojang.

üöß This is **alpha-grade** software. No guarantee is provided (see the [license](LICENSE)), and users are
responsible for the security and data-integrity of their own servers. The API surface is subject to change without notice.

üß± All the heavy-lifting is done by the excellent [itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server).
That container image is what is actually deployed into the cluster as a `Pod`. This project isn't endorsed or
supported by itzg either.

## Installing

You can install the latest version of the operator by running this command with your cluster configured in `kubectl`.

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/JamesLaverack/kubernetes-minecraft-operator/releases/latest/download/operator.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Tags

The command above will install the operator at a specific release. You can also change the image tag to either `latest`
to always get the latest published release or `edge` to get the latest build of the main branch. However, doing so won't
get you YAML updates (e.g., adding new permissions or custom resource definition updates). (Also the `edge` tag
publishes *before* tests are run, so it comes with even fewer guarantees than normal.)

### Verify

You can verify everything is working by looking for the operator Pod in the `kubernetes-minecraft-operator-system` namespace, e.g.:

```bash
kubectl --namespace kubernetes-minecraft-operator-system get pod
```

If this gives you a running Pod, then it's likely all good.

## Usage

Once the operator is installed, you can create a Minecraft server by creating a `MinecraftServer` object in Kubernetes.
This will create and manage resources such as a Pod and a Service. Resources are created in whatever namespace the
`MinecraftServer` object is in.

Note that the API uses "allowList" in place of "whitelist", but it is applied to the server in the same way.
